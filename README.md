# Catheter-Multi-Classification

## Contributors: Johnny Huang, Ruby Mattingly, Brandon Ong

Serious complications can occur as a result of malpositioned lines and tubes in patients. Doctors and nurses frequently use checklists for placement of lifesaving equipment to ensure they follow protocol in managing patients. Yet, these steps can be time consuming and are still prone to human error, especially in stressful situations when hospitals are at capacity. 

Hospital patients can have catheters and lines inserted during the course of their admission and serious complications can arise if they are positioned incorrectly. Early recognition of malpositioned tubes is the key to preventing risky complications (even death), even more so now that millions of COVID-19 patients are in need of these tubes and lines. 

In this project we will investigate a real world application by developing a deep learning model able to identify the presence or absence of different lines and tubes on chest radiographs as well as whether there is or is not a malpositioned line or tube.
